# The subtests below are "interesting".  Before test_provision_happy_path, we
# had separate tests for each stage in the task pipeline.  But each test would
# have to duplicate much of the previous test.  This was arduous and slow. Now
# we have a single test_provision_happy_path, and many subtest_foo helper
# methods.  This still makes it clear which stage in the task pipeline is
# failing (look for the subtask_foo in the traceback), and allows us to re-use
# these subtasks when testing failure scenarios.
