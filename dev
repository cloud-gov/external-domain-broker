  USAGE: $me COMMAND

  Run workflows via the development docker image.

  This provides a consistent developer experience, and avoids the "works on my
  laptop" issue.

  Examples:

    # Run the tests once
    $me

    # Same as above
    $me tests

    # Run the application, binding to port 8000
    $me serve

    # Continually watch for file changes and runs tests
    $me watch-tests

    # Start an interactive bash shell in the tests container
    $me shell

    # Create a new database migration file.
    # The new file will be in migrations/versions/
    $me new-migration "Add sprocket column to widget table"

    # Generate the pip-tools/*requirements.txt files from
    # pip-tools/*requirements.in
    $me update-requirements

    # Run command 'foo' in the container
    $me run foo
	EOF
  exit 1
